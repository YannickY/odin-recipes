        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Gnetum africanum is a popular variety of greens (edible vegetable leaves) found throughout tropical Africa — literally “found” because it grows wild in the forest and is usually not cultivated. It is a natural “forest product” that is gathered by rural people and sold in markets in cities big and small. It is even available in some African grocery stores in Europe. In English, Gnetum africanum is usually called “wild spinach” (though other plants are also called the same). In the Kikongo language of the Congo region Gnetum africanum is called Mfumbwa or Fumbwa (in Angola, M’Fumbua orFumbua). It is used to make Pondu na Fumbwa, which is also called Saka-Saka, or this recipe, another of many African greens and peanut dishes: Fumbwa elambani na Mafuta ya Nguba — Fumbwa with palm oil and peanut.</p>

            <h1>Ingredients</h1>

                <ul>
                    <li>2 lbs mfumbwa (fumbwa), or substitute any other greens: cassava leaves, collards, kale, turnip greens or similar; or spinach; cleaned, stems removed; and shredded, finely cut, or pounded in a mortar with a pestle</li>
                    <li>1 cup peanuts (or peanut butter)</li>
                    <li>2 tomatoes, peeled and chopped (or canned tomato paste, or canned tomato)</li>
                    <li>1 leek (or one onion), finely chopped</li>
                    <li>1 piece (the size of your hand) of dried, salted, or smoked fish, bones and skin removed, cleaned, soaked in water, and rinsed</li>
                    <li>1 cup red palm oil</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Steps</h1>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the greens in a large pot. Add enough water to partially cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, (do not cover), and simmer until greens begin to become tender. (Cooking time varies considerably depending on type of greens used.) Add water if pot becomes dry.<li>
                    <li>Grind, chop, or pound peanuts into a fine paste. (Or you can start with natural, sugar-free peanut butter.)</li>
                    <li>When greens are mostly tender and liquid is reduced, add tomatoes (or tomato paste), leek (or onion), and dried fish. Continue to simmer, on low heat, stirring occasionally. Simmer until everything is tender and ready to eat.</li>
                    <li>Remove a cup of the pot liquid and combine it with the peanut paste in a bowl. Stir to obtain a smooth sauce. Stir the peanut sauce into the greens, and reduce heat to as low as possible. Top with red palm oil and simmer for a few more minutes.</li>
                </ol>
